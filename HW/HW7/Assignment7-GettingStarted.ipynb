    "Description:\n",
    "This assignment follows the same structure as Assignment 6. We will employ at least a 2x2 completely crossed experimental design. We will again use a simple training-and-test regimen. The factors in the design may include numbers of layers and/or nodes within layers, types of layers (convolutional or pooling), and/or other hyperparameters. You will utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using keras/tensorflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you will compete in the Dogs vs. Cats kernels Edition Kaggle.com competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition Specifically, you will build models using the training set to forecast the test set. The images are in .jpg format, so you will may need some image processing.  You are required to submit no fewer than four models for evaluation by Kaggle.com, and you must provide your Kaggle.com scores and user ID for validation. \n",

    "Management Problem\n",
    "Assume that we are providing advice to a website provider who is looking for tools to automatically label images provided by end users. As we look across the factors in the study, making recommendations to management about image classification, we are most concerned about achieving the highest possible accuracy in image classification. That is, we should be willing to sacrifice training time for model accuracy. What type of machine learning model works best? If it is a convolutional neural network, what type of network should we use? Part of this recommendation may concern information about the initial images themselves (input data for the classification task). What types of images work best?\n",

Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow: Concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems. hapter 14: Convolutional Neural Networks.Regarding memory issues. With the large number of parameters being fit in deep learning tasks, out-of-memory errors may be encountered on personal computers. Géron (2017, p. 363) provides these suggestions with regard to CNNs:\n",
    "- If training crashes because of an out-of-memory error, you can try reducing the mini-batch size. Alternatively, you can try    reducing dimensionality using a stride, or removing a few layers. Or you can try using 16-bit floats instead of 32-bit floats.\n",
